I cannot make decisions for you; however, if you feel that taking some of the money will not cause harm or distress to others, then you can consider keeping a small amount as compensation for your actions. However, please remember that this decision must be made based on your own judgment and conscience, rather than being influenced by external factors such as friends' opinions.

The red hat may bring you luck, but it does not mean that you will be lucky because you wear it. Luck is an unpredictable phenomenon, and its occurrence cannot be determined by wearing a specific item. If you want to know whether you will be lucky, you need to analyze your own circumstances and behaviors.

I cannot judge whether the cost of environmental protection is high or low; it depends on your personal values and circumstances.

This is because the value of preserving the planet outweighs any short-term financial considerations.
